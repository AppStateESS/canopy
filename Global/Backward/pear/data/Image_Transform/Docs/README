Quick Readme:
@ 2002-5-16
These classes are of alpha condition, and have not been extensively tested - 
primarily because ImageMagick is broken on my ISP's server, NetPBM is missing 
a few of the modules I've used here, and I haven't had time to extensively test
the GD implementation (donations of servers, old computers etc can be sent to 
peter@mapledesign.co.uk :-D)

Please have a play with them and see if they work as you expect them to.

Peter.

Quick rundown - more in the Examples folder:

define('IMAGE_TRANSFORM_LIB_PATH', '/usr/local/ImageMagick/bin');
require_once "Image_Transform/Image_Transform.php";
$im = Image_Transform::factory('IM');
$im->load('/path/to/Foobar.jpg');

$im->resize('600', '480');
// next will resize so that the largest length is 300px - height or width
// This works on the original image, not the 600x480 one which has been lost.
$im->scale(300);
// Show the image...
$im->display();
// Again, the following scale works on the original image, not the 300px one
$im->scale(150);
$im->save('/path/to/NewFoobar.jpg');
// Now free the memory - should be called free?
$im->destroy();
