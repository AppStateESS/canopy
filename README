Fallout comes with its own set of Pear files. Most of the time you
should just use the included files.

To untar them:

tar zxf fallout_pear.tgz

They should be unzipped/untarred into the appropiate directories.

Although Fallout supports wysiwyg tools, you will need to download
them separately.

Please read ./docs/WYSIWYG for details.
