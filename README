Fallout comes with its own set of Pear files. Most of the time you
should just use the included files.

To untar them:

tar zxf fallout_pear.tgz

They should be unzipped/untarred into the appropiate directories.

Although Fallout supports wysiwyg tools, you will need to download
them separately.

Please read ./docs/WYSIWYG for details.

After installation you will need to install some content modules.

Login and go to the Administration tab.
Click on Boost.
Click on Other Modules
Install any of the modules included. We recommend you try them all.
If you are installing from CVS, the following modules are not
complete:
Skeleton - don't recommend installation
Profiler - can be installed but not finished

The Links module is unusable for now. Don't install it.
