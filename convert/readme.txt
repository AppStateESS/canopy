Conversion
------------------------
Each module has its own convert directory

base/convert/modules/blog
base/convert/modules/block

Make sure to check each for a "readme" file.

If there is a problem with your conversion, I recommend that you
do not continue with other mods until you can fix it. 

If you have perform the conversion more than once, you must clear the
tables and drop the sequence tables. All the conversions assume you
are starting from scratch and you haven't enter ANY content.

Go slow, backup your data, and test heavily before going live.
