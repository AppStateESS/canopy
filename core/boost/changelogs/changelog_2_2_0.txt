Global Classes
-----------------
Written for Beanie, this is a new foundation level code that will replace the
core classes. The idea is to use it for new modules and replace code in old modules.
At some point, the Global library will deprecate core classes. Even further out,
core classes will go away.

Core Classes
----------------
+ DBPager.php
- error checking added to objects without public variables
- fixed bug where DBPager would error out then quietly quit. The error now is at
  least logged.
- Added SubselectDatabase and SubselectPager classes.

+PHPWS_DB.php
- Renamed from Database.php to reflect class name.
- Moved Group_In and Where classes into their own folder.
