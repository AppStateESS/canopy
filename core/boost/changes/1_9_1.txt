1.9.1 Changes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+ session_name got lost on conversion. Fixed.
+ Template - Added option to prevent Sigma cache use.
+ Editor - moved user option above force editor define. Define was
  forcing a user who didn't want an editor to do so.
+ Form 
  o if USE_BREAKER is false, text areas will get a use breaks
    checkbox. Modules can check if it is enabled and run breaker if they
    wish.
  o Added plugIn function to form class.
  o Fix for some characters in editors.
+ Init
  o Link.php included by default
  o defines PHPWS_HOME_HTTP using Core's getCurrentUrl

+ Text
  o Added utf8 encoding before htmlentities call in parseInput to
    prevent blank text return.
  o Fixed breaker adding extra newlines.
  o Link required moved to head of file
  o Big change to character parsing. Should prevent certain characters
    from getting mangled in posting. Huge thanks to Verdon.
+ Core - users PHPWS_HOME_HTTP if all parameters are true.
+ Added extra match check to checkall javascript because match
  function is failing now for some reason.
+ Module - error variable made public to prevent error. Thanks Greg.
+ Database
  o Added extra filters to prevent values other than tables getting
    prefixed in a select statement. Thanks Olivier Sannier.
  o Added extra parameter (ignore_tables) to addJoin to allow join_on_1 and join_on_2
    to be sent arrays of parameters.
