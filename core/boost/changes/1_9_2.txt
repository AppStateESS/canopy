1.9.2 Changes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Core Classes
--------------------

  address checking. Allows "something <foo@bar.com>" format.

+ DBPager
  o class availability check added to constructor
  o getError method added
  o was missing column names when prefixed by table name
  o if a sort column is reset, indexby is no longer included
    on the link

  o added conditional define to remove dsn from log message
    if the db connection fails.
  o Added moveRow function

  o Added 'RELEASE' to do-no-allow database list

+ Error - if error.php is not found in local config directory, it
  looks in the module's inc directory.


+ Link
  o constructor uses setLabel, setLabel allows numeric
  o Added setSecure function to Link

+ Init - Dropped unneeded array declaration
+ Text
  o Patch #2571528 Eloi George - fix to getGetValues. Some
    servers returning php_self as / were fouling up directory parsing.
  o Using utf8 with completion check as a backup to iconv if not
    compiled.

Conversion
---------------------
+ Patch #2501064 - Olivier Sannier: Menu conversion now encodes
  characters better, uses short urls, and detects module possession of
  link 
+ Patch #2501057 - Olivier Sannier: Blog conversion encodes
  characters, uses short urls
+ Categories Patch #2571605 - Eloi George : After upgrade, the
  category images were not showing. The given URL was the entire
  absolute filepath. Also ran breaker on description.
+ Photoalbum Patch #2571583 - Eloi George : convertAlbum() was not
  working because the resulting SQL query was trying to write values
  to the "comments" & "anonymous" columns, which do not exist in the
  new table. 
  convertPics() was not working because $tbl_prefix was not defined.
  The included patch fixes both problems


Miscellaneous
----------------------

+ Some edits to make datepicker color neutral (i.e. gray)
+ Getting file types from inc/ directory instead of config directory.
+ Extra apostrophe check added to prompt script
