CORE CHANGES

MISC
  o Removed crutch files

CLASSES

Database.php
  o added ability to add parameters to getObjects. every variable
    after the class name is sent to the constructor
  o if a count(*) is used, the db class will clear unneccessary order
    and group designations 

Setup.php
  o added default cache directory
  o For bug #1533711 added a warning to the setup.

DBPager.php
  o fixed a filtering issue in the setSearch function
  o created addRowFunction for pagers not using classes
  o Changed the sort function to use the table columns not the class
    variables. This will help with non-class pulls
  o Added third parameter to setOrder function: only_if_empty. It is
    false by default. If true, order will only be set if not
    previously set
  o Added a function called toggle function. Supposed to call a
    specific function every specific n row. Untested but leaving in
    for now.
  o Changed the limit list so the current limit will not be linked
  o added an error check to see if the current limit request is within
    the set limit list. Should prevent users enter bogus limit numbers

  o Added a requireInc function

Editor.php
  o Added id field to editor textarea for possible future use
  o Removed breaker function call
  o Removed html_entity_decode

Form.php
  o fixed radio button label assignment
  o Removed an html decode that seemingly caused problems with
    ampersand encoding
  o Added id parameter to editor textarea
  o replaced a reference to the place variable with key. Fixes labels
    matching with elements
  o Added extra space after checked parameter
  o recoded crutch function calls since crutch files have been removed

Functions.php
  o Added stripos
  o added clone function

Key.php
  o Uses mktime for the timestamps and new Time functions for display
  o changed unregister function name to - "modulename_unregister_key"
    It was getting confused with the module's normal unregister
    function 
  o rewrote Key's unregister function to remove associations
    automatically

Manager.php
  o Recoded for compatibility

Settings.php
  o changed so that setting default files are always called before
    pulling from the database. 

Template.php
  o Forcing mod templates was getting ignored if the theme had
    comparable templates. Changed so forcing mod template overwrites
    everything.
  o Made sure forcing module templates grabbed them from the hub
      directory. 

Text.php
  o Added error check to backLink function
  o Removed the <pre> tag formating. Wasn't working anyway.
  o Added code to prevent breaks in <code> tags. They were usually
    added by the js editors
  o Added UTF-8 encoding to the parseOutput. Was trashing accented
    characters.
  o changed parseTag so you could add modules you wish to
    ignore. Should prevent endless loops
  o Changed the bbcode decoder to use str_ireplace

Time.php

    difference
