Access Module
by Matthew McNaney

Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------
The Access module allows you to manage your .htaccess file, a local
custimization file for Apache.

Access is for basic configurations ONLY. If you have complex commands
in your .htaccess file, you may want to steer clear of the Access
module.
