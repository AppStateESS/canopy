Using Captcha
by Matthew McNaney

Introduction
------------
This document instructs the reader in applying a CAPTCHA
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha) to a form in phpWebSite.


1. Include the Captcha class:

PHPWS_Core::initCoreClass('Captcha.php');


2. Create an area to echo the CAPTCHA graphic on your page and use
   Captcha's "get" method.

$tpl = $form->getTemplate();

$tpl['CAPTCHA_IMAGE'] = Captcha::get();

3. Now you need to verify the submission.

if (!Captcha::verify()) {
   echo 'You failed the CAPTCHA test!';
} else {
  postRestofForm();
}

This completes the developer application of the Captcha class.


Settings
--------
The Captcha class receives its settings from the
config/core/config.php file.

If you want to allow programs to use the captcha, set :

define('ALLOW_CAPTCHA', true);

The CAPTCHA_NAME variable defines which captcha program to use.
The CAPTCHA programs are stored in the javascript/captcha
directory. The name reflects the directory it is in.


Adding a New Captcha
--------------------
CAPTCHA scripts work like any other javascript code in phpWebSite. You
need a body.js that delivers the image. You need a head.js (usually)
to include the script in the header.

You will also need a verify.php file which includes a "verify"
function. The verify function must receive an answer string and return
a boolean result.

phpWebSite ships with freecap, an open source CAPTCHA solution by
Howard Yeend from www.puremango.co.uk. It has been altered to work
with phpWebSite. Do not expect other CAPTCHA programs to work just by
dumping them in a directory. Someone will need to mold it to work
specifically in phpWebSite.


Conclusion
----------
The above should get you started developing with and using CAPTCHAs in
your installation. We are aware of the limitations of using CAPTCHAs
(i.e. inaccessibility to the sight-impaired) and hope to have
solutions for them in the future. You may want to develop alternate
links or methods of authentication for those you don't wish to alienate.


Troubleshooting
----------------
Not working?

- Make sure you have ALLOW_CAPTCHA set to true.
- Make sure the CAPTCHA_NAME is spelled correctly.
- Verify the files inside the named CAPTCHA directory.
- Check your browser's javascript settings. Most Captchas won't
  function if javascript is disabled.
- Is the captcha using a dictionary? Do you have that dictionary
  installed?
- Is the captcha using the GD library? Have you compiled it into your
  PHP (NOT phpWebSite) installation?
- If the captcha is using a specific font, see if you have that font
  installed.
- If you are editing a CAPTCHA to work in phpWebSite, check the
  directories in the script. Often they expect to be operating in the
  root. Make them point to the proper javascript/captcha/ directory.
- phpWebSite names its sessions. If your CAPTCHA script is only using
  "session_start", it won't "see" phpWebSite's session. Do the
  following:

// if in javascript/captcha/scriptname/
include('../../../config/core/config.php');
session_name(md5(SITE_HASH . $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']));
session_start();
