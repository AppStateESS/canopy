Clipboard
by Matthew McNaney


Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------
Clipboard is a really basic module. It allows you to copy text and
paste it somewhere else in the module.

Now you may be asking, "but I can just do that via the browser."
Quite true, but how many times have you 1) overwrote your copy buffer
before you got to the destination, 2) had to instruct someone to copy
and paste an html tag, 3) had someone copy and paste the wrong
information.

Basically, for advanced users, this may be unnecessary. However, if
you want people to paste EXACT information, want to move specific code
(SmartTags for example) without having to explain what to highlight,
or just make something easier, Clipboard can help.


Copying
-----------------------------------------------------------
Lets say you wanted to clip a name to the clipboard:

$title = 'That name you wanted to copy';
$name = 'Joe Shmoe';

Clipboard::copy($title, $name);

You are done.

The Clipboard box will appear on all the pages. Just click the title
(That name you wanted to copy) and a box will pop up with a text
field with what ever you passed the copy function - Joe Shmoe.
