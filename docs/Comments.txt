phpWebSite Comments
-------------------
By Matthew McNaney

Adding comments to your content is simple. All that is required is
that your content item uses the key class (see Key.txt for details).


Creating a Thread
-------------------

First, include the Comments class:

PHPWS_Core::initModClass('comments', 'Comments.php');


Next create a thread associated to your item's key id:

$thread = Comments::getThread($key_id);

Decide if you want to allow anonymous comments in the thread:

$thread->allowAnonymous(true);

Finally, save the thread:

$thread->save();


Displaying the thread
----------------------
Now you just need to retrieve the thread and display it to your users.

Require the Comments class again if you need be.

Now retrieve the thread using the key that created it.

$thread = Comments::getThread($key);

If you need to know how many comments have been made to the thread,
call countComments like so:

printf('This item has %d comments.', $thread->countComments());

You can also have this function return a formatted version.


echo $thread->countComments(true);
// if comments == 0, echoes "No comments"
// if comments == 1, echoes "1 comment"
// if comments > 1, echoes "n comments" where n is the count


If you want to view the comments:

echo $thread->view();


Conclusion
-------------------------
That's all there is to it. The comments module handles pagination,
posting, quoting, etc.
