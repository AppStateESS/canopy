Database Rules
--------------

phpWebSite attempts to allow modules to be database OS independent. In
order to do so, please follow the rules below. 

- If importing a sql file, remember different databases quote methods
  vary. MySQL quotes like so:
  create table `example`;

  Other databases do not observe this format. Remove the ticks,
  quotes, etc. like so:
  create table example;

- Table names should not be named after database processes. In other
  words, no tables named "create", "select", etc. The same goes for
  columns.

- If importing an sql file, don't use "if exists" or "if not exists"
  in your create table query. If this is your install.sql file, the
  table shouldn't exist. If you want to be sure, add a drop table
  before the create.

- Use basic queries only: create table, alter table, insert, update,
  drop, truncate, etc. Don't use database specific commands.

- Columns should not share the name of the table they are in. This can
  confused the table prefixer.
