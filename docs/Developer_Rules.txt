1) Sessions should be at a minimum and removed from memory as soon as they are
   no longer in use.
2) Sessions should be hidden from the module developer. If your module is
   accessible by other developers, let them access information by using
   an instanced method. Keep track of your sessions separately. 0.9.3
   used this far too often.
3) Module developers should also not need to know the name of your
   GLOBAL variables.
4) Use the error class functionality. It makes it easier to debug your code.
5) When making a database dump, make it generic. For example, KEY doesn't work
   in postgres. Postgres also ignores capitalization when creating db columns.
   Also, giving sizes to integers (e.g. INT(11)) doesn't working in MicrosoftSQL.
