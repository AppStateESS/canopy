Error [notice] [-18] SELECT * FROM modules WHERE ( active = '1' )
ORDER BY priority asc  [nativecode=1146 ** Table
'database_name.modules' doesn't exist] 

Something is really wrong. The modules table is missing from your
database. As this is a core table, its existence is vital. This
is usually an indication that your database is empty as the modules
table is the first table hit by phpWebSite. Either you need to run
setup or you need to restore from backup.

Error [notice] [-27]  [nativecode=Unknown database 'database_name'] **
mysql://db_username:db_password@localhost/database_name

This is a worse error than the one above. This means you are missing
your database. You need to create the database then restore from
backup or run setup.
