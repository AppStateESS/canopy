MiniAdmin
by Matthew McNaney
----------------------------------------------

MiniAdmin is a very small module that allows you to collect
administrative menu options in one place.

It is really simple to use.

$link = '<a href="index.php?module=my_module&do=all">Do All!</a>';
MiniAdmin::add('my_module', $link);

That's all! MiniAdmin will list that link along with other
administrative links.

You do not want to use MiniAdmin indiscrimately. MiniAdmin doesn't
know why you are sending it a link. It is up to you to check the
user's permissions, what page the user is currently viewing, etc. For
example, the Categorize and Permissions link only appear when a
specific keyed item is getting viewed. The Edit blogs link only
appears when all the blogs are getting viewed. None of the links
appear if the user doesn't have the permissions to administrate those
options.
