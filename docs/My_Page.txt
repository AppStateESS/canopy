My Page by Matthew McNaney
-------------------------------------

My Page is special user setting page within the Users module. You can
get to it by clicking on the My Page tab under your control panel.

Tabs under My Page are only for generic user settings. ANY user would
have access to these settings.


Registering your module
------------------------------------
This is simple. You just need to create a my_page.php file in your
module's inc/ directory. When you module installs, the User module
will see it and register your module. If you want to add a My Page tab
later, you can call:
My_Page::registerMyPage('module_title');


Contents of your My Page file
------------------------------------
You need to have one function call in your my_page.php file.

function my_page()
{
    return "My module's My Page content.";
}

When your module's tab is accessed, My_Page will call the my_page
function and print the results. Whether you continue to add
functionality in this file or within your module's classes is up to
you.


Operating in My Page
-----------------------------------
Remember that you are not inside YOUR module. You are in a subset of
the user's module. Therefore, when you are creating a form or a link
that works inside My Page, it has to contain certain variables.

module = users
action = user
tab = your module tab

This shouldn't be that hard to remember as the data will be in your
address bar when accessing your My Page tab.

When creating forms, you need to have these variables as hidden
variables. You may either add these manually or you can send a form
object to My_Page::addHidden. For example:

$form = & new PHPWS_Form('my_mod_info');
My_Page::addHidden($form);

$form->addText('birthday');
...

Users uses a variable named "command". If you try to create a GET or
POST variable named "command", phpWebSite will return a 404 error.
