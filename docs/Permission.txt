Permissioning in phpWebSite 1.x by Matthew McNaney
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.0 First draft


Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------
When designing a complex module for phpWebSite, a need arises to limit
accessibility. Only certain users should edit items. A smaller section
could delete those items.

phpWebSite's Users module assists developers in this task.

This document covers two aspects of permissioning - the developer's
and the administrators. If you are not a developer, you may skip down
to the section "Administering Users."


User Session
----------------------------------------------------------------------
phpWebSite's previous version necessitated use of the OBJ_user
session. The current version operates with a user session, however
developers will not access it directly. Instead, coders call
static methods within the Current_User class. Problems with retaining
a logged status after installation frequently indicate session
problems.


Deity
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Those familiar with the previous version of phpWebSite recognize this
term. A "Deity" in phpWebSite refers to a user with ultimate
power. The site opens very module and action to this users.

The first user created during installation is a deity. Only a deity
create or destroy another deity account. Deities
