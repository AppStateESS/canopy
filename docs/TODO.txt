Approval
-----------
Main menu for approval needed

Icon for control panel

Users
-----------
Give the admin the ability to ban someone from logging in. Block ip as
well?

Figure out a clean way to assign permissions to a specific user (i.e.
without pulling up the entire list of users)

Finish new user signup.

Make assigning of groups by a restricted user limited. Don't want them
to give more permissions to themselves than they currently have.

Have a mechanism for other modules to perform processes when a user is
deleted.

General work and tweaking
