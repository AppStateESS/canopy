Give the admin the ability to ban someone from logging in. Block ip as
well?

Figure out a clean way to assign permissions to a specific user (i.e.
without pulling up the entire list of users)

Finish new user signup. Confirm email address as well.
Add instructions some describing the signup.

Check into time zone for users set at creation.


Make assigning of groups by a restricted user limited. Don't want them
to give more permissions to themselves than they currently have.

Have a mechanism for other modules to perform processes when a user is
deleted.
