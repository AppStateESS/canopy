BBcode in phpWebsite
by Matthew McNaney
------------------------------

In most cases, phpWebSite modules parse anonymous and registered
user-submitted data for html tags. To allow those users to express
themselves, phpWebSite uses BBcodes. These are special characters that
allow html markup without the use of html tags. For example:
[b]text[/b] = Bold text
[i]text[/i] = Italicized text
[url="http://www.google.com"] = Clickable link to Google

The developers of phpBB have a great FAQ here:

Smilies
-----------------------------------------
phpWebsite ships with basic 'smilie' support.

You may want to expand upon your collection. Here is an excellent
source of graphics:
http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=282009
(Note: this package has since discontinued. Google smilie+pak)

To add your smilies:
1) copy the graphics into images/core/smilies/
2) edit/copy over your config/core/smiles.pak file

The release linked to above contains its own smiles.pak file. If you
want to allow the use of all the smilies, just drop it into the
config/core/ directory. If you want to add a config line the format
is below. _Ignore the newlines_. They are inserted for
clarity.

name_of_image.ext
=+:
Title of Image
=+:
shortcutWord

For example, look at the smilies for Very Happy

icon.biggrin.gif
=+:
Very Happy
=+:
:D


All together this looks like this:

icon_biggrin.gif=+:Very Happy=+::D

So then, if I typed
:D

in a comment, I would get the icon_biggrin.gif graphic instead.
