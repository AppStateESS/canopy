Upload memory limits
---------------------

There are several places an upload file limit can be set. The lowest
limit will always take precedent. If you are having problems with File
Cabinet uploads, this is the document to read.

Here is where to look:

1) The module settings
The module you are using (File Cabinet for example) may have limits
imposed on the system. See if the module has a settings screen or a
config file that is controlling the maximum bytes allowed.

2) The Form Class
phpWebSite's form class is governed by two upload limits. The first is
set in the config/core/formConfig.php file:

define('FORM_MAX_FILE_SIZE', 5000000);

3) phpWebSite's Upload Limit
The core libraries have an absolute limit. This is set in the
config/core/config.php

define('ABSOLUTE_UPLOAD_LIMIT', '5000000');

This setting exists because the form limit can be set by a
developer. So a module could allow an 100MB upload and enforce this
value in the form object. Setting an absolute limit prevents this from
happening.


4) The server setting
No matter what you have set in phpWebSite, the server trumps all
values. If you need to increase the server upload limit, look for the
php.ini file. Look in /etc/php5/apache2/, /etc/php/conf/, or run
a find . -type f -name 'php.ini'
