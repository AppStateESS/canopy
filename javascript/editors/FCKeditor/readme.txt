The files in this directory allow the FCKeditor to work in phpWebSite.

We do not supply the editor. You will need to download it from here:
http://www.fckeditor.net/

Unzip the file into this directory. You should see _something_ like
the following when reading the directory contents:

head.js
license.txt
_packager (dir)

You should be able to remove any other files and folders.

--> DO NOT remove the license.txt file. <--

Please see the Editors.txt file in the docs/ directory for more
information.
