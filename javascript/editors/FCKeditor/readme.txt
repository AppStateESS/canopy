The files in this directory allow the FCKeditor to work in phpWebSite.

We do not supply the editor. You will need to download it from here:
http://www.fckeditor.net/

Unzip the file into this directory. You should see _something_ like
the following when reading the directory contents:

body.js
default.php
_docs (dir)
editor (dir)
fckconfig.js
fckeditor.js
fckstyles.xml
head.js
license.txt
_packager (dir)
readme.txt (this file)

You should be able to remove any other files and folders.

--> DO NOT remove the license.txt file. <--

The custom.php allows you to change the default options for
FCKeditor. It must reside in the editor directory.

***  Make sure to read spellcheck_readme.txt ***
***        to enable the spellchecker.       ***

The word 'content' is restricted. Do not use it as the name of
your text area.

Please see the Editors.txt file in the docs/ directory for more
information.

One final word: FCK's ease of use is due to the hard work of the
FCKeditor team. If one of the main reasons you enjoy working in
phpWebSite is because of the editor, PLEASE support (i.e. send money
to) the FCKeditor team.
