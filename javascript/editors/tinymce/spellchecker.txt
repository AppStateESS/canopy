Spell checking information
by Matt McNaney


TinyMCE uses a plug-in called spellchecker. If you are having
problems, look here:

javascript/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/spellchecker/config.php

These lines determine the type of spell checking you will perform:

// General settings
$config['general.engine'] = 'GoogleSpell';
//$config['general.engine'] = 'PSpell';
//$config['general.engine'] = 'PSpellShell';

The default condition runs off a Google dictionary. If this is not
working for you you can try the alternates. Both require you have
aspell on your server but PSpell requires compile within php. The
PSpellShell option works if your php script can run a shellexec.

Much like FCKeditor, you will need to have a defined aspell path:

$config['PSpellShell.aspell'] = '/usr/bin/aspell';

If you are using Windows look below it for a sample commented line of
code:

//$config['PSpellShell.aspell'] = '"c:\Program Files\Aspell\bin\aspell.exe"';

You will also need a web server writable temporary directory:

$config['PSpellShell.tmp'] = '/tmp';

or in Windows

//$config['PSpellShell.tmp'] = 'c:/temp';

If you are still unable to get spellchecker to function, please check
the TinyMCE site for help.
