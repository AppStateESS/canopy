The YUI editor is the Yahoo! UI Library: Rich Text Editor.

This implementation pulls the javascript files from the Yahoo! site:
http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.3.0/

Updating the script should be as easy as raising the build version
number.

One change made was the inclusion of the skin.css locally. Using the
default or pulling it from Yahoo caused all kinds of problems. It
worked ok if you add the yui-skin-sam class to the body tag, but you
can't expect people to do that themselves. I tried wrapping the
textarea in a div with the yui-skin-sam class but, contrary to their
assertions, it didn't work. So the included style sheet just dumps
their yui-skin-sam style altogether.

If you don't want to run the script off their servers, you can do the
following: 

1) Download the yui package from the yahoo site:
   http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/
2) Unzip it into the yui directory where you are reading this file.
3) Rename head.js to head.bak or something.
4) Rename head.local.js to head.js

Both head.js files use bare bones configurations. If you want to add
other bells and whistles, that's up to you. If you'd like to suggest a
default configuration, please post to the project site at Sourceforge.

I am not including a suggested file with this editor.
