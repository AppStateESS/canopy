The PEAR library included with phpWebSite is a subset of the original. Some directories and files have been removed.
These directories and files included documentation and test files. LICENCE files were not deleted.
Also, some files were updated to conform to strict PHP standards. A PEAR update WILL overwrite these changes but should
not change the functionality.

If you want the full versions, see the README file included with this distribution.
