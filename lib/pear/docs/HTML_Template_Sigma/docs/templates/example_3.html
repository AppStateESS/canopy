<h1>&Sigma;<sub>template</sub> example 3: building template from multiple files</h1>

<p>Please note that block names should be unique within the template even if the template is built from multiple files. Therefore it is usually a <b>bad</b> idea to include one file in two different places, unless this file contains no blocks.</p>

<h2>1. Using &lt;!-- INCLUDE filename --&gt; within template</h2>
<p>This is the way to include a file from within a template, no additional code is required in your script. Note that this creates no blocks except ones already present in main and included files.</p>

<!-- INCLUDE example_3_include.html -->

<h2>2. Using addBlockfile()</h2>
<p><b>addBlockfile()</b> creates a new block in place of a variable placeholder.</p>

{addblockfile}

<h2>3. Using replaceBlockfile()</h2>
<p><b>replaceBlockfile()</b> replaces the existing block with a new content.</p>

<h3>3.1 Keeping the previously parsed contents</h3>
<p>You can keep the parsed contents of the original block and continue iteration over the new one.</p>
<ul>
<!-- BEGIN replace_block_1 -->
    <li>Original block: {item_title}</li>
<!-- END replace_block_1 -->
</ul>

<h3>3.2 Discarding the previously parsed contents</h3>
<p>Or you can discard the parsed contents and start from scratch (this is the default behaviour).</p>
<!-- BEGIN replace_block_2 -->
<ul>
    <!-- BEGIN replace_block_2_item -->
    <li>{item_title}</li>
    <!-- END replace_block_2_item -->
</ul>
<!-- END replace_block_2 -->
