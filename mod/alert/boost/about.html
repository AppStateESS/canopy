<h1>Alert</h1>
<h3>By Matthew McNaney</h3>
<p>Alert was originally written for a campus alert web site. It
would allow administrators to post critical information that would
appear on the front page. That same information could then be mass
emailed to users imported into the program. The program checks off each
participant to be sure that everyone is emailed. If the browser is shut
down during the process, you can log back on and continue.</p>
<p>We ended up not using it but include it anyway in case someone
could use it.</p>
