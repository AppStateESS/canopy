phpWebSite Analytics module
by Jeff Tickle <jtickle at tux dot appstate dot edu>
-----------------------------------

I whipped this thing together a few months ago so that we could offer some
delicious Google Analytics action to various websites that we host, and in
my haste, I never added an admin interface, only a database table.  Then,
at the insistance of trf000 on IRC, I added a rudimentary admin interface.

Analytics supports Google Analytics, Piwik, and Open Web Analytics.  It is
also extensible to other cloud-based analytics systems - just make a class
in class/trackers (see GenericTracker.php for an example), and add some
templates to /templates.  More specificity below.

-----------------------------------

TEMPLATE TAG

In your theme template, add an ANALYTICS_END_BODY tag at the very end of your
BODY tag.  This can be put pretty much anywhere in the page, and if you don't
put it in your theme.tpl, things will still work.  HOWEVER: if you've ever
been to a web page that is slow to load and you see "Wating for Google
Analytics," it is because they did not put the script at the end of their
BODY, but rather at the top or in the HEAD.  So please, do us all a favor
and put it at the end of your BODY tag.

-----------------------------------

GOOGLE ANALYTICS WITH THE PHPWEBSITE ANALYTICS MODULE

Go to the New Tracker tab.

"Friendly Name" is just a name you can use to identify
it besides "GoogleAnalyticsTracker."  I don't know why you would ever need
more than one Google Analytics tracker on a website, or even if that is
allowed by Google's TOS, but this thing will allow you to set up
multiple instances and have them be active simultaneously.

"Currently Active" is whether or not the tracker is active.  Checked means
it will show up in ever page, unchecked means it won't.

Account Identifier is the unique ID for your analytics account, and it can
be found like so:

1. Log in to Google Analytics
2. Select your website
3. Your unique ID will appear next to your host name.  For example:

http://website.com UA-12345678-9

The "UA-12345678-9" part is your unique ID.  As of version 1.1.0, you DO need
the UA- part, so enter "UA-12345678-9" into the account field.

-----------------------------------

CUSTOM ANALYTICS ENGINES WITH THE PHPWEBSITE ANALYTICS MODULE

The Analytics module should make adding your own cloud-based Analytics
engine easy.  If it's a popular service, please send us your Tracker
class, and we will consider adding it to the phpWebSite distribution.

Have a look at class/trackers/GoogleAnalyticsTracker to get an idea
for how this works.  All Trackers extend the Tracker class and implement
five functions: trackerType(), track(), addForm(), processForm(), and joinDb()

public function trackerType()
simply returns the name of the class.  This could probably be
better done with reflection, but I didn't think about it at the time.

public function track()
is called at runtime to add the javascript for your tracker engine
to the end of the body.  In the case of GoogleAnalyticsTracker, I am just
putting the TRACKER_ID into the GoogleAnalytics.tpl template, and using the
self::addEndBody($string) utility to make sure it ends up in the right
place in the main page template.

Another thing you could do here is directly ping a remote script that would
keep track of certain information and never actually place anything into
the body.  Piwik does offer something like this, but their PHP script just
adds the tracking javascript to your website, so I figured let's cut out
the middleman and do it ourselves.  I trust I will regret that someday.

public function addForm(PHPWS_Form &$form)
allows you to add fields to the administrative edit form.  For example,
OpenWebAnalyticsTracker uses this extensively, as there are several options
that you can pass in on the tracking request other than just the siteID.

public function processForm(array $values)
gives you the form that was submitted administratively so that you can
properly save the custom fields provided in addForm() to the database.

public function joinDb(PHPWS_DB &$db)
lets you add a join on analytics_tracker with your own table.  The key here
is that your tracker's id should be the same as the analytics_tracker id.
By definition, that makes it a "sparse" table - not every id will be
covered by an individual tracker's table.

-----------------------------------

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

The ability to connect your Analytics trackers to data reporting APIs such
as what Piwik provides would be nice, so that you can view your tracking
data from within phpWebSite.  This is very low on my priorities though and
would require significant additions to the module; however, if you want to
give it a shot and submit a patch, we would be grateful!

CHANGELOG

2012 Jun 04 Jeff Tickle <jtickle@tux.appstate.edu> 1.1.0
* Added database support for trackers to collect whatever information they need;
  no longer restricted to an arbitrary 'account' field.
- Update script should properly migrate existing config for Google Analytics.
* Removed the assumption that Google Analytics accounts begin with 'UA-'.  This
  was the most confusing thing about Analytics, and it's just an unsafe
  assumption in general.
* Added support for Trackers to "add to" the admin form, and take the submitted
  data and put it in their own table.
* Added support for Piwik <http://piwik.org>
* Added support for Open Web Analytics <http://openwebanalytics.com>
