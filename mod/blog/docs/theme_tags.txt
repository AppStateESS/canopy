Blog only uses three theme tags.

Name: view
Tag : BLOG_VIEW
---------------
Blog will put this content into the BODY tag, not the DEFAULT tag if
the theme does not assign it. It contains the full blog entry
listing (title, body, comment links, etc.).

Name: previous_entries
Tag : BLOG_PREVIOUS_ENTRIES
---------------------------
This is a listing of past blog entries. Any not seen on the default
view page are listed.


Name: recent_entries
Tag : BLOG_RECENT_ENTRIES
-------------------------
If the admin decides not to show the current blog on the home page,
this block will show up instead. It contains the titles of new blogs.
