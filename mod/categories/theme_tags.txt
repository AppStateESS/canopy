Categories only has one content variable.

Name: Admin_Menu
Tag : CATEGORIES_ADMIN_MENU
----------------------------
If the user administrating the site does not have javascript enabled,
an administration menu appears in this block instead. It is not really
worth the time to create a special theme tag for it. DEFAULT should be
sufficient.
