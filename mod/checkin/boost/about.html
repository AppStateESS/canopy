<h1>Checkin</h1>
<h3>By Matthew McNaney</h3>
<p>Our Financial Aid office sees a lot of students. So many students
arrive with so many different concerns requiring various lengths that
Financial Aid implemented walk-in service. Scheduling just wouldn't
work.</p>
<p>I originally wrote this for 0.10.x. For 1.x, I figured I might as
well generalize it and offer it to other people.</p>
<p>Basically, you add users to the system. Each user can be labeled
as "staff." Meanwhile, the front office allows students to enter their
first and last name and their reason for being there - the reasons are
created administratively. Depending on their reason for being there or
their last name, they will be assigned to a staff member.</p>
<p>Staff members have three statuses - available, not available, and
meeting with visitor. Their status prevents or allows visitors to be
assigned to them. A green "available" status means the front desk should
send back the visitor. When the visitor arrives, the staff go into the
meeting status.</p>
<p>Checkin records when the visitor arrived and for how long they
met with the staff. This allows reports showing total time visitors
waited to be seen and how long their visit with the staff lasted.</p>
<p>It should be obvious that this was designed for Intranet
purposes. Visitors signing up from anywhere on the Internet would cause
problems.</p>
