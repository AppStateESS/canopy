Introduction
----------------------------
This file contains all the tags that go into the comment view templates.
LABEL tags are translatable phrases that clarify areas in the
template. In other words instead of:

Edited by: {EDIT_AUTHOR}

the template uses

{EDIT_LABEL}: {EDIT_AUTHOR}

If you are serving English users only, you can remove these from the
templates.
