<h1>Elections</h1>
<h3>By Verdon Vaillancourt</h3>

<p>Elections is a module that allows you to run one or more elections
(ballots). A ballot may have a title, a description, an image, and any
number of candidates. Ballots may be set to be public viewable (or not),
public may vote (or not), min and max selections settings, and many
other options. Ballots may also be set to allow ranking of candidates
(assign points to candidates).</p>

<p>Candidates may have a title, description and image, as well as up to
four optional custom fields.</p>

<p>Although voting is logged, only the fact that a vote was cast is
logged. All voting is secret. At this time, a recorded vote is not
supported.</p>

<p>There are many options, settings and reports. Please explore.</p>
