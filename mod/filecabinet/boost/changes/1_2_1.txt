1.2.1 changes
--------------
+ Changing image file rights after upload and resizing to 644
+ Document permissions written as 640
+ Fixed update script. Was missing filecabinet_pins table creation.
+ Option add to auto link child resized images to parent.
+ Fixed bug where child images were not getting loaded on image
  selection.
+ File cabinet was pulling a file from the mod directory instead of
  locally. I think I misread the function.
+ Resize the image edit window to account for thumbnail.
+ Image selection would get corrupted by linked images. Fixed.
