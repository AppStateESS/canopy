FFMpeg Use in File Cabinet
by Matthew McNaney
---------------------------

Introduction
-------------
After uploading a FLV video, you may have noticed the generic image icon
that accompanies it. In order to have a proper screenshot, you will
need to enable FFMpeg.


What is FFMpeg?
---------------
FFMpeg is a superb open source video tool. Read more about it here:
http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/

This documentation is limited to phpWebSite use only.

Enabling FFMpeg
---------------
First, find out where it is installed.

> which ffmpeg
/usr/bin/ffmpeg

Now go to the Settings tab in File Cabinet and type the directory
without the application name:

/usr/bin/

If phpWebSite finds the executable, the "Enable FFMpeg thumbnails"
checkbox will no longer be grayed out. Click on it to check and update
your settings.

File Cabinet should now attempt to create a screen shot from the
video.


Troubleshooting
---------------
Make sure that you have downloaded the proper FLV codecs. Without
them, FFMpeg can't process your Flash or AVI video. If you are not
getting thumbnails, then you probably don't have the codec on your
server.
