Flash movie filters were written using two other projects:

FlowPlayer : http://flowplayer.sourceforge.net/index.html
SWFObject  : http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject/


FlowPlayer
---------------------------------------
FlowPlayer is a customizable Shockwave file that enables flv
playback.

The following files have been removed from FlowPlayer:

FlowPlayerJs.html
FlowPlayerJs2.html
FlowPlayer.html

They are included as examples with FlowPlayer.

If you are happy with the functionality of FlowPlayer, please consider
visiting the developer's site and contributing to his project.
http://flowplayer.sourceforge.net/


SWFObject
-------------------------------------------
SWFObject embeds Shockwave files in a XHTML and cross platform
accessible... thing. 

The only file used from SWFObject is swfobject.js. You can obtain the
source from their web site. The forementioned file is a condensed
version of the source.


The LICENSE file in this directory belongs to FlowPlayer.

Special thanks to Anssi Piirainen and Geoff Stearns for releasing
