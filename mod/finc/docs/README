<p>This is the first release of finc for the new 1.x series phpwebsite.
It's pretty simple and there may not be any further releases, unless
bugs are found. I wrote this for a specific need I had and thought it
may be of use to others also.</p>

<p>Caution: This module could be dangerous. You are expected to have
some idea of what you are doing, if you are going to use it. It could be
used to do nasty or stupid things. I have intentionally not included
file upload abilites to it. If you do not have access to the server, you
should not be using this.</p>
