<h1>ngBoost Tab "Application"</h1>
<p>
Application modules become installed by your requests. Just click the link "Install"
to enable a module for your site. Some modules may have dependencies to other modules.
That means, before installing the desired module the installation of the dependent
module is required. To see the dependencies, just click the "MissingDependency" link.
</p><p>
Just installed modules with dependencies have a link "DependUpon", that leads to
more informations about the dependent module(s). The mentioned link also signals,
the module cannot be uninstalled because of such conditions. That means, the dependent
modules have to be uninstalled before.
</p><p>
When "Check" results to the knowledge of a newer version available, a dialog is
opened when the link of the version number is clicked. The dialog enables to copy the
newer module from the distribution server to your servers repository. Thus, the module
archive (a *.tgz file) becomes visible by tab "Repository" and click "ListRepository".
From that point, when clicking "Recover", the new modules archive is decompressed into
your modules file system and then ready to install.
</p><p>
In case the module is just installed and a new version is available, the handling is
nearly the same as for uninstalled modules: Click on the version number, copy the
newer module from the distro server to your server and decompress the archive via tab
"Repository" following link "Recover". With just installed modules, a link "Update" 
will be offered to make the newer version to the current one.
</p><p>
Keep in mind, it is always suggested to make backups before running any updates and/or
uninstallations. Backups for the file system are offered on tabs "core" and
"Application", while backups for the database are on tab "Database". To have consistence
backup sets, both (file system and database) have to regard. Backup copies are
always present in the repository and may be recovered from there.
