<h1>ngBoost Tab "Application"</h1>
<p>
Application modules become installed on your requests. Just click the link <b>Install</b>
to enable a module for your site. Some modules may have dependencies to other modules.
That means, before installing the desired module the installation of the dependent
module is required. To see the dependencies, just click the <b>MissingDependency</b> link.
</p><p>
Just installed modules with dependencies have a link <b>DependUpon</b>, that leads to
more informations about the dependent module(s). The mentioned link also signals,
the module cannot be uninstalled because of such conditions. That means, the dependent
modules have to be uninstalled before.
</p><p>
When <b>Check</b> results to the knowledge of a newer version available, a dialog is
opened when the link of the version number is clicked. The dialog enables to let copy,
verify, decompress and expand the newer module from the distribution server to your site. 
In case the module is just installed and a new version is available, the handling is
nearly the same as for uninstalled modules: Click on the version number, let copy the
newer module from the distro server to your server. With just installed modules, a link
<b>Update</b> will be offered to make the newer version to the current one.
</p><p>
Keep in mind, it is always suggested to make backups before running any updates and/or
uninstallations. Backups for the file system are offered on tabs <i>Core</i> and
<i>Application</i>, while backups for the database are on tab <i>Database</i>. To have consistent
backup sets, both file system backup and database backup have to regard.
Backup copies are placed in the repository and may be recovered from there.
