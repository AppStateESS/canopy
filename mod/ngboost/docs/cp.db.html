<h1>ControlPanel ngBoost Tab "DB"</h1>

<h4>ListTables</h4>
<p>Shows the database tables of phpWebSite/ngWebSite with the module names they belong to.
Each single table can be backed up (<b>Backup Table</b>) or all tables of a module (<b>Backup Module Tables</b>).
To backup all tables of the site, use (<b>BackupAllTables</b>).
The backup data will be stored with timestamped filenames in the repository, from where tables are eligable to
recover (Tab Repository).</p>
<p>Only tables of installed modules will be backed up. Not installed modules do not have database tables in use.
The table data are backed up together with crc checksums to support integrity 
verifications in case when restored.</p>
<h4>Messages with "Recover"</h4>
Example:
<pre>Import start with skeleton.sysbu.20110214-095211.db.skeleton_bones.data
Import done for skeleton_bones, 1 rows, 0 errors, 1 ok, 0 neCRC, 1 eqCRC.</pre>
<p>The filename with the timestamp of the recovery input data is told and
the number of rows processed for the table. The recover can be successfully (ok)
or with errors (error). <b>neSRC</b> tells, how many rows are changed against the native
backup in the recovery data, while <b>eqCRC</b> confirms the data unchanged. Note, changed
data do <b>not</b> prevent rows to become restored.</p>
