<h1>ControlPanel ngBoost Tab "DB"</h1>

<h4>Messages with "Recover"</h4>
Example:
<pre>Import start with skeleton.sysbu.20110214-095211.db.skeleton_bones.data
Import done for skeleton_bones, 1 rows, 0 errors, 1 ok, 0 neCRC, 1 eqCRC.</pre>
<p>The filename with the timestamp of the recovery input data is told and
the number of rows processed for the table. The recover can be successfully (ok)
or with errors (error). <b>neSRC</b> tells, how many rows are changed against the native
backup in the recovery data, while <b>eqCRC</b> confirms the data unchanged. Note, changed
data do not prevent rows to become restored.</p>
