<h1>ngBoost Tab "Distros"</h1>
<p></p>
<h4>"List"</h4>
<p>
Lists the content of the selected distribution. The list shows the modules (also
those not part of a release) and enables to retrieve such modules just not present on the site.
Modules present, but not installed may be purged from the file system to safe space and may be retrieved
again in case such module is wanted yet.
</p>
<h4>"SelectDistro"</h4>
<p>
You may select one of the distribution servers for version checking and providing
the source packages from. The selection is made available to ensure boosting is available also
in case a distrubution server is not available or unaccessible.
</p>
<h4>"Patos"</h4>
<p>
Patos are "Patches Optional" that may become applied to the site. While the boost update processes
 are performed in a predetermined order (ie for a module a version 1.0.1 grows to 1.0.2) and are stored
 for the site with their states, patos represent updates by patches not necessarily to only one specific module.
 Patos are intented for updates to gain some extra behaviour, but also to receive new themes or i18n
 translations. As far patos affect modules and/or core, a boost update/upgrade will overwrite the patos.
 In such case, desired patos need to be re-applied. Patos are delived with comprehensive descriptions to
 show how they will act on.
