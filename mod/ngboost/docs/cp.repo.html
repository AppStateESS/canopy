<h1>ngBoost Tab "Repository"</h1>
<p>
A repository is a place on your server outside the public view. Any visitor of your site
is not able to see the content of the repository, because the place is outside of what the
web server offers to the public. Only programmable access is supported.
</p><p>
The repository is used for backup copies from the file system and the database and for core
and module archives for the site. ngBoost can load distro archives from the distribution
server directly into the repository (that is a server/server transfer). No more need to use
Ftp or similar to transfer from server to client and from client to server. ngBoost also
is able to decomress archives of the tar/tgz formats.
</p><p>
To use a repository click the link "VerifyRepositoryPath".
</p><p>
To see the content of the repository, click "ListRepository", where actions are offered:
<br />
"Dir" to look into an archive.
<br />
"Recover" to restore backed up data.
<br />
"Purge" to delete a backup file if no more needed.
