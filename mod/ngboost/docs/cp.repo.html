<h1>ngBoost Tab "Repository"</h1>
<p>
A repository is a place on your server outside the public view. Any visitor of your site
is not able to see the content of the repository, because the place is outside of what the
web server offers to the public. Only programmable access is supported.
</p><p>
The repository is used for backup copies from the file system and the database and for core
and module archives for the site. ngBoost can load distro archives from the distribution
server directly into the repository (that is a server/server transfer). No more need to use
Ftp or similar to transfer from server to client and from client to server. ngBoost also
is able to decomress archives of the tar/tgz formats.
</p><p>
To use (and create) a repository a very 1st time click the link <b>VerifyRepositoryPath</b>.
The verification should be ok,
but may fail in case ngBoost is not able to find a permitted place outsite the web servers public
scope. In such case, the only one who can help is the system user of the site by manually creating a
directory named <i>".repository"</i>. Anycase, the repository only can be used when the place
is offline to the public.
</p><p>
To see the content of the repository, click <b>ListRepository</b>, where actions are offered:
<br />
<b>Dir</b> to look into an archive.
<br />
<b>Recover</b> to restore backed up data.
<br />
<b>Purge</b> to delete a backup file if no more needed.
