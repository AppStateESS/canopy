<h4>"Patos"</h4>
<p>
Patos are patch options that may become applied to the site. While the boost update processes
 are performed in a "linear" order (ie a version 1.0.1 grows to 1.0.2), patos are "patched"
 updates. Patos are intented for updates to have some usual behaviour, but also to receive
 new themes.
