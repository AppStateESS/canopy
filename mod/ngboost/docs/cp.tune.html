<h3>ControlPanel ngBoost Tab "Tune"</h3>
<h4>"Distro"</h4>
<p>
You may select one of the distribution server sources for version checking and providing
the source packages. The selection is made available to ensure boosting is available also
in case a distrubution server is not available or unaccessible.
</p>
<h4>"Patos"</h4>
<p>
Patos are patch options that may become applied to the site. While the boost update processes
 are performed in a "linear" order (ie a version 1.0.1 grows to 1.0.2), patos are "patched"
 updates. Patos are intented for updates to have some usual behaviour, but also to receive
 new themes.
