1.0.1 Changes
-------------------------------------------------------------
+ Front page placement now available
+ Widened the action column in page list
+ Caching added to page display.
+ Clearing the lorum ipsum text each new page is redundant. Changed
  to only showing on new page.
+ Was using nbsp to fill blank content. This gave false positives in
  the layout. nbsp are only used now for form layout.
+ Javascript changed to add nbsp on blank entry to prevent collapsing
  forms.
