Creating Page Templates for PageSmith
by Matthew McNaney


All page templates should reside in the page_templates directory under
the templates/pagesmith directory:

For example, if you page template was named my_template

templates/pagesmith/page_templates/my_template

PageSmith's default templates reside in
mod/pagesmith/templates/page_templates. Should they get updated, the
results will be copied into the templates/pagesmith/page_templates
directory.


Page Template files
----------------------
All files related to the page template reside in these directories.


structure.xml
-------------
Your page template directory requires a structure.xml file. The
following example is from the simple template:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<template>
<title>Simple</title>
<summary>One large text area with right float block.</summary>
<thumbnail>simple.png</thumbnail>
<style>page.css</style>
<structure>
   <section>
      <name>header1</name>
      <type>header</type>
   </section>
   <section>
      <name>text1</name>
      <type>text</type>
   </section>
   <section>
      <name>image1</name>
      <type>image</type>
      <width>300</width>
      <height>300</height>
   </section>
</structure>
</template>

The <title> appears over the <thumbnail> on the selection screen. The
<summary> describes the page layout. If present, the <style> tag
indicates which style sheet to use when the page is displayed.

The last tag, <structure> contains the <section>s that make up the
page template.

Each <section> contains at least its <name> and <type>. The <name>
labels an area of the page template. The <type> tells PageSmith what
kind of section to expect when editing and displaying.

If the section is an image, the maximum <width> and <height> should be
set as well.


page.tpl
------------
The page template itself should be named 'page.tpl'. The template
needs to be specially contructed so that it will not only display
properly, but also so site users can edit it.
