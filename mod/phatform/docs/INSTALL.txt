Installation of PhatForm
------------------------

1. Untar the phatform files into your phpwebsite's mod directory:

      tar -xzf phatform_2.10.tar.gz

2. Change the permissions on the phatform/export and phatform/archive
   directories to give the web server write permissions:

      Root access:
         chown apache.apache phatform/export phatform/archive

      Non-Root access:
         chmod 777 phatform/export phatform/archive

   Shell scripts are provided in the phatform/util/ directory that
   will automagically set your permissions for you.  Simply change
   to the phatform/util directory and execute 'chownphat.sh' if you
   have root access to the machine, or 'chmodphat.sh' if you don't
   have root access:

      Root access:
         cd mod/phatform/util/
         ./chownphat.sh username.group

      Non-Root access:
         cd mod/phatform/util/
         ./chmodphat.sh

3. Using your browser open your phpwebsite site and login as a deity
   user.

4. Select 'Modules' from your user menu and enter the Boost module.

5. Select the 'Install' button next to the module titled 'Form Generator'.

6. Enjoy!
