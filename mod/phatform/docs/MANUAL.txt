Phatform Manual
---------------

In our rush to release phatform to the public, Steven and
Adam have not had time to put together a good user manual
yet. Time will be spent over the next few weeks or months
to create this document as swiftly as possible.

We are always looking for help with compiling documentation.
Both for phpWebSite as a whole and phatform in particular.
If you are interested in helping to create a user manual
for phatform, please contact Adam Morton via email at
adam@NOSPAM.tux.appstate.edu.  Remove the 'NOSPAM.'.
