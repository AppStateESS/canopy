This is a conversion of Phatform (Form Generator). It was originally
written for versions of phpWebsite under 1.0.

Unlike modules written expressly for 1.x, Phatform will NOT work under
postgresql.

Phatform was originally written by Adam Morton and Steven
Levin. Darren Green is responsible for some features, modifications
and patches.

Phatform will requires about 2mb of memory to operate. Adjust your
memory limit appropriately (10mb or more) in the
config/core/config.php file.
