Please be aware this is a conversion of Photo Album. It was not
designed specifically to run in 1.0.

As a result, some bugs may remain and you will be unable to run it
under Postgresql.

Also, it requires a great deal of memory compared to 1.x modules.
Please go to your config/core/config.php file and uncomment this line:

ini_set('memory_limit', '10M');

You should probably set this number to around 18M ESPECIALLY if you
are also running Form Generator.
