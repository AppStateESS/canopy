INSTALL steps for phpwsbb

IMPORTANT: phpwsbb is a module for phpWebSite 1.3.0 or higher.  You have to
install phpWebSite >= 1.3.0 first, phpwsbb will not work with
earlier versions of phpWebSite.  If you don't have phpWebSite installed,
first get the latest code here:

https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15539

Then follow the install instructions found in the INSTALL.txt included in the
docs directory of that download.

1. Download the .tar.gz from a sourceforge mirror.

2. Unpack the tarball with:
    tar -xvzf phpwsbb-*.tar.gz

   This will create a directory named "phpwsbb-<version>".

3. Move the directory into your phpwebsite mod directory and rename it
   to "phpwsbb".

   Example: If you are installing phpwsbb 0.8.0 and your
   phpwebsite directory is /home/httpd/htdocs, you would run
    
   mv phpwsbb-0.8.0 /home/httpd/htdocs/mod/phpwsbb

   If you are upgrading an existing install, simply copy the contents of the
   phpwsbb-0.8.0 directory into /home/httpd/htdocs/mod/phpwsbb.

   cp -R phpwsbb-0.8.0/* /home/httpd/htdocs/mod/phpwsbb

4. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE.  If you use mysql, mysqldump is recommended.

5. Go to your phpWS website and install or upgrade "Bulletin Board"  from the
   Boost module.

   You are golden.  The bulletin board is now installed.  You can get there
   by going to "Control Panel" and click on "Site Content".  However this
   means anonymous users won't be able to post.  So you'll need to make a
   menu link.
