<p>This is the third release of podcaster for the new 1.x series
phpwebsite. This release takes advantage of the new File Cabinet 2.0
features, and media upload/embed tools are now built right in. Support
for PDF and other documents types has also been added. Podcaster is now
searchable with the search module, and new access module and short url
features are implimented.<p>

<p>A note on media types: You may specify at a channel level what media
type you will allow for all episodes in that channel. Ideally, you
should determine this before adding episodes to a channel, though it can
be changed at any time.</p>

<p>A note on restricted users: If you are allowing restricted users to
add podcast episodes, you will also need to allow them to upload to the
appropriate folder(s) in File Cabinet.</p>

<p>A note on permissons: Honestly, I'm still working on understanding
the new system completely. I've done a basic security audit and although
I am sure there is no gross holes, I'm sure I may have something wrong
too ;-) I wanted to get this rewrite out asap and will do a more
thorough permissioning review for the next podcaster release.</p>
