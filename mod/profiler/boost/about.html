<h1>Profiler</h1>
<h3>By Matthew McNaney</h3>
<p>Profiler was originally built for a specific university function.
This function is no longer needed.<br />
It is included just in case someone finds a need for it.</p>
<p>Basically, the module lets you create categories of people. You
can then enter information on these people and feature snapshots of them
on the front page. When the snapshots are clicked, it brings the user to
a larger write-up of that person.</p>
