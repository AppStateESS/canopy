<p>This is the first version of vMail for phpWebsite 1.x. It was
inspired by the mailto module for 0.x but goes a bit further</p>

<p>vMail allows you to create spam-proof mailto forms. Forms are keyed
items and may be easily added to menus or other content. A list of all
vMail recipients is provided, as well as an optional sidebox for a quick
contacts list.</p>
