The vPath module has two optional theme tags. 

Name: view
Tag : VPATH_VIEW
---------------------
Normally, the vpath view is styled horizontally. It might be best
to place it near the top of your theme.

Name: sub
Tag : VPATH_SUB
---------------------
Normally, the vpath sub is styled vertically. It might be best
to place it near the top of a column in your theme.
