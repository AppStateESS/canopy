1.0.0 Changes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Several permission checks were not using the correct item name
  (volume).
+ Approval tab is no longer seen by restricted users.
+ Removed duplicate approval call.
+ Fixed: Approval pages were not limited by volume number causing all
  unapproved pages to list when a volume was viewed.
+ Unapproved volumes will appear on the list for the person who
  last updated them. This will allow them to edit while still in the
  queue.
+ Unapproved pages are listed with an [Unapproved] label in the volume
  listing. 
+ Fixed: Restricted users were not seeing the front page and active
  status. 
+ Fixed: When volumes were approved, the approver was getting the
  update status applied to them. There is a parameter on the save
  function to prevent that now.
+ Fixed: The key save for the volume was not error checked.
+ Incorrect commands to the user class will forward to a 404 page.
+ The creator of a web page is no longer given edit rights by default.
+ After approved, edit item rights are given to the user's
  groups. Groups must have edit rights to receive item rights.
+ Altered column widths and joined active and front page.
+ Tidied the header.tpl to not show bars for admin options.

+ Updated: templates/forms/list.tpl, templates/header.tpl
