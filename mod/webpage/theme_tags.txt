The Web Page module has two content variables.

Name: featured
Tag : WEBPAGE_FEATURED
----------------------
Admins can choose to highlight specific pages. The page title and
summary are listed. This appears only on the front page.

Name: page_view
Tag : WEBPAGE_PAGE_VIEW
------------------------
When a Web Page is set to appear on the home page, it is displayed in
this theme tag. By default, the content will be pushed into the BODY
tag. Obviously this tag should allow for a large viewing area.
