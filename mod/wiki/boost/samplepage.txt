++ General Notes

All text is entered as plain text, and will be converted to HTML entities as necessary.  This means that {{<}}, {{>}}, {{&}}, and so on are converted for you (except in special situations where the characters are Wiki markup).

Just hit "return" twice to make a paragraph break.

----

++ Inline Formatting

||~ Code ||~ Output ||
|| {{``//emphasis text//``}} || //emphasis text// ||
|| {{``**strong text**``}} || **strong text** ||
|| {{``//**emphasis and strong**//``}} || //**emphasis and strong**// ||
|| {{``{{teletype text}}``}} || {{teletype text}} ||
|| {{``@@--- delete text +++ insert text @@``}} || @@--- delete text +++ insert text @@ ||
|| {{``@@--- delete only @@``}} || @@--- delete only @@ ||
|| {{``@@+++ insert only @@``}} || @@+++ insert only @@ ||

++ Literal Text

If you don't want to parse some text, enclose it in two backticks (not single-quotes).

<code>

This //text// gets **parsed**.

``This //text// does not get **parsed**.``

</code>

This //text// gets **parsed**.

``This //text// does not get **parsed**.``

----

++ Headings

You can make various levels of heading by putting equals-signs before and after the text (all on its own line):

<code>
+++ Level 3 Heading
++++ Level 4 Heading
+++++ Level 5 Heading
++++++ Level 6 Heading
</code>

+++ Level 3 Heading
++++ Level 4 Heading
+++++ Level 5 Heading
++++++ Level 6 Heading

----

++ Table of Contents

To create a list of every heading, with a link to that heading, put a table of contents tag on its own line.

<code>
[[toc]]
</code>

----

++ Horizontal Rules

Use four dashes ({{``----``}}) to create a horizontal rule.

----

++ Lists

+++ Bullet Lists

You can create bullet lists by starting a paragraph with one or more asterisks.

<code>
* Bullet one
 * Sub-bullet
</code>

* Bullet one
 * Sub-bullet

+++ Numbered Lists

Similarly, you can create numbered lists by starting a paragraph with one or more hashes.

<code>
# Numero uno
# Number two
 # Sub-item
</code>

# Numero uno
# Number two
 # Sub-item


+++ Mixing Bullet and Number List Items

You can mix and match bullet and number lists:

<code>
# Number one
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
# Number two
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
  * Sub-bullet
   # Sub-sub-number
   # Sub-sub-number
# Number three
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
</code>

# Number one
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
# Number two
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
  * Sub-bullet
   # Sub-sub-number
   # Sub-sub-number
# Number three
 * Bullet
 * Bullet


+++ Definition Lists

You can create a definition (description) list with the following syntax:

<code>
: Item 1 : Something
: Item 2 : Something else
</code>

: Item 1 : Something
: Item 2 : Something else

----

++ Block Quotes

You can mark a blockquote by starting a line with one or more '>' characters, followed by a space and the text to be quoted.

<code>
This is normal text here.

> Indent me! The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
>
> Another block, leading to...
>> Second level of indenting.  This second is indented even more than the previous one.

Back to normal text.
</code>

This is normal text here.

> Indent me! The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
>
> Another block, leading to...
>> Second level of indenting.  This second is indented even more than the previous one.

Back to normal text.

++ Links and Images

+++ Wiki Links

SmashWordsTogether to create a page link.

You can force a WikiPage name '''not''' to be clickable by putting an exclamation mark in front of it.

<code>
WikiPage !WikiPage
</code>

WikiPage !WikiPage

You can create a "described" or "labeled" link to a wiki page by putting the page name in brackets, followed by some text.

<code>
[WikiPage Descriptive text for the link.]
</code>

[WikiPage Descriptive text for the link.]

+++ Interwiki links

Interwiki links are links to pages on other Wiki sites.  Type the {{SiteName:PageName}} like this:

Wikipedia:PhpWebSite

You can create a "described" or "labeled" link to a interwiki page by putting the page name in brackets, followed by some text.

<code>
[Wikipedia:PhpWebSite View the phpWebSite page on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.]
</code>

[Wikipedia:PhpWebSite View the phpWebSite page on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.]

+++ URLs

Create a remote link simply by typing its URL: http://sf.net/projects/phpwebsite-comm.

If you like, enclose it in brackets to create a numbered reference and avoid cluttering the page; {{``[http://sf.net/projects/phpwebsite-comm]``}} becomes [http://sf.net/projects/phpwebsite-comm].

Or you can have a described-reference instead of a numbered reference:

<code>
[http://pear.php.net PEAR]
</code>

[http://pear.php.net PEAR]

+++ Images

You can put a picture in a page by typing the URL to the picture (it must end in gif, jpg, or png).
<code>
http://c2.com/sig/wiki.gif
</code>

http://c2.com/sig/wiki.gif

You can use the described-reference URL markup to give the image an ALT tag:
<code>
[http://www.web.appstate.edu/images/logo.gif Appalachian State University]
</code>

[http://www.web.appstate.edu/images/logo.gif Appalachian State University]

----

++ Code Blocks

Create code blocks by using {{<code>...</code>}} tags (each on its own line).

<code>
This is an example code block!
</code>


To create PHP blocks that get automatically colorized when you use PHP tags, simply surround the code with {{<code type="php">...</code>}} tags (the tags themselves should each be on their own lines).

<code>
 <code type="php">
 // Set up the wiki options
 $options = array();
 $options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

 // load the text for the requested page
 $text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

 // create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
 $wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

 // transform the wiki text.
 echo $wiki->transform($text);
 </code>
</code>

<code type="php">
// Set up the wiki options
$options = array();
$options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

// load the text for the requested page
$text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

// create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
$wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

// transform the wiki text.
echo $wiki->transform($text);
</code>

----

++ Tables

You can create tables using pairs of vertical bars:

<code>
|| cell one || cell two ||
|||| big ol' line ||
|| cell four || cell five ||
|| cell six || here's a very long cell ||
</code>

|| cell one || cell two ||
|||| big ol' line ||
|| cell four || cell five ||
|| cell six || here's a very long cell ||

<code>
|| lines must start and end || with double vertical bars || nothing ||
|| cells are separated by || double vertical bars || nothing ||
|||| you can span multiple columns by || starting each cell ||
|| with extra cell |||| separators ||
|||||| but perhaps an example is the easiest way to see ||
