===== IMPORTANT =====

This version of Wiki for phpWebSite requires phpWebSite 1.2.0 or higher. You
have to install phpWebSite >= 1.2.0 first - earlier versions of phpWebSite
will not work. If you are running phpWebSite 0.10.x, grab the latest 0.x.x
version of this module.

If you don't have phpWebSite installed, first get the latest code here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15539

Then follow the install instructions found in the INSTALL file included in
the docs directory of that download. Once this is done then you can start
installing Wiki for phpWebSite.


===== INSTALLATION =====

1. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE.  Never install this or any other module without
   doing this.

2. Download the .tar.gz or .zip file from sourceforge and unpack it.

3. Move the new directory into your phpWebSite mod directory.

    Example: If your phpWebSite directory is /home/httpd/htdocs, you would run:

    mv wiki /home/httpd/htdocs/mod/wiki

4. Go to your web site and install/update Wiki from Boost.

5. Log out and log back in to your site to reset your environment before
   using the module.

   The module is now installed.

6. If your site is no longer behaving like normal, try uncommenting the
   following line in config/core/config.php of your phpWebSite install:

   ini_set('memory_limit', '10M');

   The Text_Wiki library that this module relies on uses quite a bit of
   memory and uncommenting the above line will allow phpWebSite to use
   more memory.  If you don't give phpWebSite enough memory to use, it
   will not work properly (or at all).


===== UPGRADING FROM WIKI 0.x.x =====

1. Install this version of the Wiki module on your new phpWebSite 1.x.x
   (a.k.a. Fallout) site using the directions above.

2. Copy the convert directory of this module to the convert/modules directory
   of your phpWebSite install.  Rename it to 'wiki'.

   Example: If your phpwebsite directory is /home/httpd/htdocs, you would run:

   cp -R wiki/convert /home/httpd/htdocs/convert/modules/wiki

3. Open convert.php in the directory you just copied and set the
   OLD_WIKI_IMAGES define to the appropriate value.  Make sure to uncomment
   the line.

4. Confirm your 0.10.x phpWebSite is running Wiki 0.5.0 or later.  You can not
   upgrade to this version from earlier versions of the module.  If you are not
   running at least 0.5.0, download the latest 0.x.x version and upgrade your
   0.10.x site.

5. Go to www.yournewsite.com/convert and the Wiki Converter will handle the
   rest!
