Setting Permissions

If you are running Apache under Linux/Unix you have two options:

1) Log in as root and CHOWN the directory to apache.apache like so
   chown -R websrv.websrv directoryName/
   
   websrv is the user and group name of the web server. For example, 
   Apache uses "apache" or sometimes "nobody". So for an Apache
   installation, I would use:
   chown -R apache.apache directoryName/

2) If you can't log in as root, a less secure way is:
   chmod -R 777 directoryName/

After installation of phpWebSite or its modules, the following directories
should remain writable:

phpwebsite/images/
phpwebsite/files/

These two directories need to be writable only during a phpwebsite or module
install:

phpwebsite/templates/
phpwebsite/config/

Make sure to restrict the permissions on those directories after done with
your installation.
