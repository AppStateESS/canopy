Setting Permissions

If you are running Apache under Linux/Unix you have two options:

1) Log in as root and CHOWN the directory to websrv.websrv like so
   chown -R websrv.websrv directoryName/
   
   websrv is the user and group name of the web server. For example, 
   Apache uses "apache" or sometimes "nobody". So for an Apache
   installation, I would use:
   chown -R apache.apache directoryName/

   The "-R" makes it work recursively.

2) If you can't log in as root, a less secure way is:
   chmod -R 777 directoryName/

You MUST change the permissions back after setup.

After installation of phpWebSite or its modules, the following directories
should remain writable:

phpwebsite/images/
phpwebsite/files/
phpwebsite/logs/

These three directories need to be writable only during a module install
or update:

phpwebsite/templates/
phpwebsite/config/
phpwebsite/javascript/modules/

Make sure to restrict the permissions on those directories after done with
your installation.

Note: You may be asking "Why doesn't phpWebSite do this for me?"
phpWebSite can call chown and chmod, but php itself would need
directory permissions. You do not want php to be root or the directory
owner.
