$content[] = '<b>Welcome to the phpWebSite 1.0.0 (also called "Fallout") Beta installation</b><br />
<p>1.0.0 is an upgrade to the phpWebSite version 0.x software.
It has been redesigned and coded from the ground up.</p>

<p>We have added MANY new features to phpWebSite to benefit users and developers alike.
Please be aware, however, that the version you are installing now is incomplete.
<ul>
<li> It is not yet 100% compatible with the 0.x series of phpWebSite.</li>
<li> We have not written the Branch module.</li>
<li> Some functionality may be missing.</li>
<li> Bugs may abound.</li>
<li> Language translation has not been tested.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The good news is that the code seems stable enough to use in a production environment.
Keep the above in mind, however, before you depend on its use.</p>';
