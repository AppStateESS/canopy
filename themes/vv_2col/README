This theme is meant to be a clean framework for a 2 column layout. It is
not meant to be used as is and the colours are a little quirky on
purpose. They should help you get a sense of the structure quickly
though. I have tried to comment the css with enough information to get
you started. Most people will only ever need to edit default.css to
achieve many different looks and feels.

Please don't re-order the main layout divs in theme.tpl. Moving these
out of order will break the layout. This layout is search engine
friendly in that it renders main content first, followed by left/right 
column; without the css. I have also added a new content are to the 
default set. I have added {BANNERS}.

CSS Most of your work will be in default.css.

position.css is where the main elements of the layout are defined. Go
here to change the column widths and padding. Otherwise, you likely
won't need to edit anything there.

basic.css is where a lot of sizes and margins and stuff are defined. Go
here to change font sizes and padding within boxes and so on.

default.css is where all the colours and backgrounds and font styles and
so on are defined. You can do most of your theme within this one file.

You could easily add other alternate stylesheets, either for
content-specific design, or just to provide options to visitors. To do
that, refer to /docs/Theme_Creation.txt or to the default phpws theme
for inspiration.

NOTE ON CHANGING THIS TO A RIGHT COLUMN LAYOUT
You only need to make a couple changes. 

1) in position.css around lines 50-70 replace with the following

/* 2 Column (right menu) settings */
.rightmenu {
    /*background:#eee;		/* right column background colour */
}
.rightmenu .colleft {
    right:25%;			    /* right column width */
    /*background:#fff;		/* left column background colour */
}
.rightmenu .col1 {
    width:71%;			    /* left column content width (left column width minus left and right padding) */
    left:27%;			    /* (right column width) plus (left column left padding) */
}
.rightmenu .col2 {
    width:21%;			    /* right column content width (right column width minus left and right padding) */
    left:31%;			    /* (right column width) plus (left column left and right padding) plus (right column left padding) */
}


2) in default.css around lines 49-65 replace with the following

/* right column background colour */
.rightmenu {
    background: #CF9;
}

/* left column background */
.rightmenu .colleft
{
	background-color: #fff;
}

/* right column contents background */
.col2
{
	background-color: transparent;
}


3) In theme.tpl around line 36 replace with the following

<div class="colmask rightmenu">
